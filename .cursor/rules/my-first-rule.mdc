# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

## Requirements:
- **High-Level Overview First**: Before breaking any requested change or task into discrete steps, provide:
  1. **Overview** – a concise summary of what you intend to accomplish.
  2. **Mind-Map** – a textual, hierarchical outline of all sub-tasks and relationships.
  3. **Roadmap** – a sequential list of each planned step with brief descriptions.
- Always ask for my explicit “yes” before executing any actual step.
- After each step, summarize completion and ask for permission to proceed to the next step.
- If I respond “no” or request a modification at any point, pause, adjust according to feedback, and then re-present the modified overview/mind-map/roadmap before continuing.
- Maintain clear numbering so steps are never skipped or repeated.

## Task:
- For any code generation, refactoring, or file operations I request, follow this protocol:
  1. **Overview**: Write a short paragraph summarizing the entire task.
  2. **Mind-Map**: Present a textual hierarchy (e.g., bullets/indentation) that shows all major sub-tasks and how they relate.
  3. **Roadmap**: List each step in order (e.g., “Step 1: …”, “Step 2: …”, etc.) with one-line descriptions.
  4. Ask: “May I proceed with Step 1?”  
     - Wait for my “yes” (or “no/cancel”) before doing anything.
  5. On “yes,” execute Step 1.
  6. Summarize Step 1 completion in one or two sentences. Then ask: “Ready for Step 2?”
  7. Repeat steps 5–6 until all steps in the Roadmap are complete.
  8. After the final step, provide a **Final Summary** of all actions taken, including any file changes.

## Things you shouldn’t do to avoid code corruption:
- ❌ Do NOT perform any code edits before presenting the Overview, Mind-Map, and Roadmap.
- ❌ Do NOT merge multiple steps into one; each logical action must be its own Step X.
- ❌ Do NOT overwrite existing files or functions without my explicit “yes” for that specific step.
- ❌ Do NOT skip any confirmations—waiting for my permission is mandatory.
- ❌ Do NOT move or delete code blocks outside of a confirmed step.
- ❌ Do NOT assume you can cut corners; if uncertain, ask clarifying questions.

## Explanation:
Whenever you (Cursor’s AI) receive a new instruction, you must first think:  
> “What is the full scope? Which parts depend on which? How can I break this into safe, incremental actions?”

1. **Overview** (e.g., “We need to migrate all usages of `double` to `BigDecimal` in `calculateTotal()` and update related tests.”)  
2. **Mind-Map** (e.g.,  
   - Migrate `calculateTotal()` signature  
     - Change input types  
     - Change return type  
     - Adjust internal calculations  
   - Update call sites  
     - Locate all calls  
     - Modify arguments  
   - Update tests  
     - Identify affected tests  
     - Refactor assertions  
   )  
3. **Roadmap** (e.g.,  
   - Step 1: Analyze `calculateTotal()` existing signature and behavior.  
   - Step 2: Modify `calculateTotal()` method signature to use `BigDecimal`.  
   - Step 3: Update all call sites in code.  
   - Step 4: Adjust unit tests related to `calculateTotal()`.  
   - Step 5: Run tests and verify correctness.  
   - Step 6: Final review and cleanup.  
   )

Only after I reply “yes” to Step 1 should you implement Step 1. After finishing, confirm with me and ask for Step 2, and so on.

Following these rules guarantees you’ll never perform an unwanted change in bulk and prevents accidental code corruption. Always treat each “Step X” as a standalone mini-task that requires explicit consent before proceeding.
