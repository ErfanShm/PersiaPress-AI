# Focus Keywords (Generate First)
Focus Keywords (کلمات کلیدی کانونی):

Generate **up to four relevant focus keywords** in Persian based on the source title and body. Define their roles and target presence:
*   **Primary Keyword (کلمه کلیدی اصلی):** Generate **one primary focus keyword**. This is the absolute most important term, directly representing the core topic. Target density: ~1%. Provide this for the `primary_focus_keyword` key.
*   **Secondary Keyword (کلمه کلیدی ثانویه):** Generate **one secondary focus keyword**. This is the next most important related term, often targeting a key sub-topic or closely related concept. Target density: ~0.5%. Provide this for the `secondary_focus_keyword` key.
*   **Additional Keywords (کلمات کلیدی اضافی):** Generate **up to two additional focus keywords**. These should target important LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) terms, synonyms, or related concepts that broaden the article's reach. Target density: ~0.25% each. Provide these as a list of strings for the `additional_focus_keywords` key.
*   **General:** You can mix Persian and English terms within each keyword if it represents a common search phrase or technical concept (e.g., 'راهکارهای یادگیری AI'). Total combined density should be around 1.5-2.0%, integrated naturally. **Avoid keyword stuffing.**

These keywords will be used to optimize other elements.

Title (عنوان):
*   Create a compelling Persian H1 title incorporating `primary_focus_keyword` (and `secondary_focus_keyword` if natural).
*   Keep meaning close to source. Prioritize English for major international brands (e.g., `Reddit`).
*   Enhance readability with Power Words or numbers if natural.

*   Create a compelling and relevant title in Persian for the **main blog post heading (H1)**.
*   Incorporate the `primary_focus_keyword`.
*   Try to naturally incorporate the `secondary_focus_keyword` as well, if possible without sacrificing clarity or sounding forced.
*   Try to keep the meaning very close to the original source title, translating it appropriately into natural Persian.
*   **Handling English Terms:** 
    *   Retain original English terms for technical concepts, brand names, specific jargon, or proper nouns where a direct Persian translation might lose meaning, search relevance, or accuracy. 
    *   **For major international brand names (e.g., Reddit, Google, OpenAI), prioritize using the original English name in the H1 title.** If a Persian transliteration is commonly used and aids readability, it can follow in parentheses, but the English form should be prominent (e.g., `Reddit (ردیت)` or simply `Reddit`).
    *   Alternatively, if you translate other technical terms to Persian, include the original English term in parentheses `()` immediately after the translation (e.g., `هوش مصنوعی (AI)`).
*   **Title Readability Enhancement:** 
    *   Attempt to use a **Power Word** (like "شگفت‌انگیز", "ضروری", "اثبات‌شده", "راز", "نهایی", "ساده") if it fits naturally and enhances clickability.
    *   Consider including a **number** (e.g., "7 راهکار...") if it makes sense for the content (like a list post).

# NEW: SEO Title (Rank Math)
SEO Title (عنوان سئو):

*   Generate a separate, concise title specifically optimized for **search engine results pages (SERPs)**.
*   **Strictly keep this title under 60 characters.**
*   **Crucially, the exact `primary_focus_keyword` MUST be included prominently, ideally starting the SEO title. This is a strict SEO requirement.**
*   Base it on the main Title and keywords, but prioritize brevity and SERP click-through rate.

Permalink/Slug (پیوندیکتا):

Generate a concise, SEO-friendly permalink (slug) based primarily on the `primary_focus_keyword` and source title.
Must be entirely in English. Use hyphens (-) to separate words.
Should accurately reflect the main topic and keywords.
Example: ai-learning-solutions

Meta Description (توضیح):

*   Write a compelling meta description in Persian (strictly between 150-160 characters).
*   **Crucially, the exact `primary_focus_keyword` MUST be included naturally within the description. This is a strict SEO requirement.**
*   Try to naturally incorporate the `secondary_focus_keyword` as well, if possible.
*   Accurately summarize the post's content to maximize click-through rate (CTR) from search results.
*   Include a strong call-to-action (e.g., "بیشتر بدانید") to improve CTR.

Content Generation:

*   **Introduction:** In the first paragraph, include a friendly, personal greeting addressing the Hooshews (هوشیوز) audience directly, but **do not always place it as the very first sentence**. Vary the placement and style of the greeting to keep introductions feeling natural and diverse. Write the introduction (and the whole post) in a conversational, almost journal-like tone. Connect the topic to hooshews.com's focus on AI/tech news.
*   **Focus Keyword Placement:** 
    *   **Crucially, include the exact `primary_focus_keyword` within the first 10% of the main content body (after the intro).**
    *   **Incorporate the `primary_focus_keyword` naturally into at least one `##` (H2) or `###` (H3) heading. Also incorporate the `secondary_focus_keyword` into other `##` (H2) or `###` (H3) headings where relevant.** This is important for on-page SEO.
    *   Maintain a **natural keyword density** for *all* focus keywords throughout the content, aiming for approximately 1.5-2.0% density *combined* (Primary: ~1%, Secondary: ~0.5%, Additional: ~0.25% each), integrated naturally. **Avoid keyword stuffing.**
*   **Body:** Write a comprehensive, *unique* Persian blog post that summarizes, explains, and potentially *adds value beyond* the key information from the source body. 
    *   **Strictly avoid copying sentences or significant phrases** from the source body. Focus on synthesizing information and expressing it in **completely original wording**.
    *   When instructed to **'add value beyond'** the source, this means incorporating elements like: **original analysis, unique examples relevant to the Persian audience, connections to recent local events or trends (if applicable), or a concluding thought/opinion.**
    *   **Target a minimum word count of 600 words, aiming for longer comprehensive content where appropriate.** Ensure the content is unique and is not just a rehash or direct translation.
*   **Structure & Readability:** 
    *   Structure the content beautifully using Markdown. Make it visually appealing and easy to scan. Use Markdown elements like bullet points (`* point`), numbered lists (`1. point`), bold text (`**important term**`).
    *   Use appropriate Markdown for headings (e.g., `##` for H2 headings, `###` for H3 headings).
    *   **Crucially, keep paragraphs short and focused, ideally 2-4 sentences and well under 120 words each.**
    *   Add at least one unique insight or perspective (e.g., a practical tip, a local context, or a forward-looking question). <--- This aligns with the 'add value' instruction above.
    *   **Suggest Media:** Where appropriate, insert placeholders like `[پیشنهاد تصویر: توضیح تصویر مورد نیاز در اینجا]` or `[پیشنهاد ویدیو: توضیح ویدیوی مورد نیاز در اینجا]` to guide manual media insertion later.
*   **Handling English Terms:** Within the body text, follow the same principle as for the title: keep essential English terms directly, or if translating, follow with the English term in parentheses `()` (e.g., `یادگیری ماشین (Machine Learning)`).
*   **Quote Handling & Attribution:** When including a direct quote:
    *   Format the quote distinctly using **Markdown blockquote syntax (prefix each line of the quote with '> ')**. You may optionally also use Persian quotation marks `« »` within the blockquoted text if appropriate for style.
    *   **Crucially, provide clear attribution.** Identify the speaker/author and their relevant title or role.
    *   Specify the context: where or when the quote originated (e.g., a specific event, publication, year).
    *   If a reliable online source for the quote exists (e.g., an official transcript, article, or interview), attempt to find and include a Markdown link `[منبع نقل قول](URL)` immediately after the attribution.
    *   Attribute using an em dash (`—`) before the source information on a new line below the quote (this should also be part of the blockquote if it directly follows the quoted text).
*   **Linking (External):** 
    *   **Goal:** Enhance credibility and provide value by linking externally to high-quality, authoritative sources.
    *   **What to Link:** Identify opportunities to link key **English terms, brand names (like OpenAI, Google Gemini), specific data points, technical concepts, or cited studies/sources** to their official/authoritative URLs.
    *   **Relevance & Value:** Only add links that genuinely enhance the reader's understanding or provide necessary attribution/evidence. Prioritize quality over quantity (a few good links are better than many weak ones).
    *   **Anchor Text:** Use **natural and descriptive anchor text** (the `[linked text]` part) that accurately reflects the content of the target URL. Avoid generic text like "click here".
    *   **URL Guessing:** Attempt to find the most relevant official or authoritative URL (e.g., link 'OpenAI' to `https://openai.com/`).
    *   **Format:** Embed these links **directly** within the content body using standard Markdown syntax: `[طبیعی و توصیفی لنگر متن](URL)`. Ensure the URL is valid.
    *   **Selectivity:** Be professional and selective; do not over-link.
    *   *Internal linking will be handled manually.* 
*   **Language & Conclusion:**
    *   Use Persian numerals (e.g., ۱, ۲, ۳) for any numbers within the Persian text.
    *   Conclude the main body of the article with a Markdown horizontal rule (`---`) on its own line, followed immediately by the source attribution text formatted exactly as: `منبع: [{source_name}]({source_url})` using the provided source name and URL.

Thumbnail Image:

*   Alt Text (متن جایگزین): Provide descriptive Persian alt text for the thumbnail image. **Crucially, include the exact `primary_focus_keyword` naturally within the alt text.** Try to include the `secondary_focus_keyword` as well if natural. Incorporate other relevant keywords (from the source title and body) for image SEO.
*   Filename: The English `slug` generated will be used to create the filename `hooshews.com-[slug].webp` later.

Tags:

# MODIFIED: Ask for specific English AND general Persian tags
Suggest a total of **up to 7 tags** based on the source title and body, chosen for SEO value and relevance:
*   **3 English Tags:** Focus on **specific entities, technical terms, or proper nouns** (e.g., "Google Gemini", "OpenAI", "LLM", "API"). Avoid general conceptual English tags.
*   **4 Persian Tags:** Focus on **general but highly relevant SEO keywords** related to the topic (e.g., "هوش مصنوعی", "امنیت آنلاین", "گوگل", "فناوری").
