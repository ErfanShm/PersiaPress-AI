Instagram Image Prompt for Viral Static Post:

Generate a single, creative prompt for a static Instagram post image:

- Start with: `Create image for an Instagram post.`
- Visualize a bold, satirical, and visually striking scene inspired by the [HEADER] and [DESCRIPTION], playfully poking fun at the tech/AI world, its trends, or personalities.
- The image should be eye-catching, unordinary, a little bit naughty and abnormal, but always highly relevant to the topic and suitable for a tech/AI news post.
- Use clever exaggeration, industry in-jokes, or surreal elements to create a sense of "AI culture satire"â€”not childish or slapstick.

**Static Image Design Focus:**

- High contrast and dramatic lighting for mobile viewing
- Intricate details that reward closer inspection
- Perfect balance and visual hierarchy for immediate comprehension
