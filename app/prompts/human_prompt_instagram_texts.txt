{takeaways_formatted}

**1. Viral Post Title (for the post's visual/thumbnail):**

* **Language:** Persian
* **Length:** Super short (ideally 3-7 words).
* **Style:** Explosively viral. Make it bold, playful, and a bit "naughty" or highly provocative in a clever way (think intriguing double meanings, not offensive). It must spark immediate curiosity or amazement and make people *need* to know more.
* **Hook:** Should be an irresistible hook that makes people stop scrolling.
* **Wordplay:** Use clever wordplay, a surprising twist, or a challenging statement if possible.
* **Impact:** Aim for something that makes people laugh, blush slightly, feel mischievous, or be utterly amazed.
* **Emojis:** Add 1-2 relevant emojis that enhance the title's vibe.

**2. Instagram Post Caption (Stylized for Readability & Engagement):**

* **Language:** Persian
* **Overall Style:** Highly readable, engaging, and visually broken up for Instagram. Think short, punchy lines and mini-paragraphs. Use emojis strategically for emphasis and visual appeal.
* **Tone (Reiteration for Emphasis):** Professional, engaging, and approachable. Maintain a tone that reflects expertise and trustworthiness, while still being interesting and inviting for the "hooshews" AI community. Avoid overly casual, slangy, or attention-seeking language. Humor, if used, should be subtle, intelligent, and witty, aligning with a tech-savvy audience.

* **Structure & Formatting Guidelines:**
    *   **Short Lines:** Keep most lines relatively short. Use single newlines (`\n`) frequently to create visual breaks and improve scannability.
    *   **Mini-Paragraphs/Stanzas:** Group related sentences into small blocks of 1-3 lines, separated by a single newline.
    *   **Strategic Emojis:**
        *   Use emojis sparingly and purposefully. They should only be used if they genuinely enhance the message or visual appeal, not as mere decoration. Aim for a maximum of 1-2 well-placed emojis in the entire caption, if any. The strength of the caption should come from compelling copy, not emoji overuse.
    *   **Hook:** Start with a strong, intriguing hook (can be a question or a bold statement).
    *   **Summary:** Briefly summarize the core topic (using the AI-Derived Key Takeaways) in an exciting, digestible way, broken into these short, stylized lines.
    *   **Engagement Questions:** Weave in 1-2 thought-provoking questions, each perhaps on its own line or as a short stanza.
    *   **Call-to-Action (CTA):**
        *   Make the CTA very clear and visually distinct. It could be its own stanza.
        *   Instruct users to comment with **{derived_cta_word}** to receive the full blog link in their DMs.
        *   Mention the link in the "hooshews" page bio.
    *   **Hashtags:**
        *   Place all hashtags at the very end of the caption, on their own line(s) after any other text.
        *   Provide exactly 5 hashtags: 3 highly relevant Persian and 2 highly relevant English, each starting with '#'.
        *   **Selection Strategy:** These hashtags are crucial for increasing visibility, maximizing reach, and enhancing discoverability. Aim for a strategic mix:
            *   Include some **popular/broader** Persian hashtags for wider reach.
            *   Include some **niche-specific** Persian and English hashtags directly related to the post's core AI/tech topic for targeted engagement.
            *   Consider using a **branded hashtag** like #hooshews or #هوشیوز as one of the English or Persian tags if it fits naturally within the count.
            *   If relevant and suitable for the content, try to align one or two hashtags with **trending topics** in the AI/tech space (but prioritize relevance over chasing trends).
        *   Ensure hashtags are space-separated if on the same line, or on new lines.
