Image Prompt for Blog Post Thumbnail:

Create image for a blog post thumbnail.
- Visualize the core theme of the `[HEADER]` and `[DESCRIPTION]` in a **clean, minimal, professional** 16:9 style.
- The scene should resemble a **simple, elegant** editorial photograph with clear focal points and minimal clutter.
- Focus on **clean UI design principles** with plenty of white space and clear visual hierarchy.
- Keep the design **informative but not complex** - viewers should understand the concept immediately.
- Use the Hooshews brand color `#4379f2` only as a small accent (e.g., a button light, logo detail, or display element), **not as the main theme or background**.
- Optionally include a subtle nod to "Hooshews" via screen content, documents, or a tiny logo â€” but only if it fits naturally.
