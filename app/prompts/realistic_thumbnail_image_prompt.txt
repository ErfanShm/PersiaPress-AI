Image Prompt for Blog Post Thumbnail:

Create image for a blog post thumbnail.
- Visualize the core theme of the `[HEADER]` and `[DESCRIPTION]` in a **realistic, professional, photojournalistic** style.
- The scene should resemble a high-quality, editorial photograph or a cinematic still. Prioritize realism, natural lighting, and credible-looking environments or people.
- Subtly include the provided character's likeness as a minor element — like someone in the background or on a screen — blended into the setting realistically.
- Use the Hooshews brand color `#4379f2` only as a small accent (e.g., a button light, logo detail, or display element), **not as the main theme or background**.
- Optionally include a subtle nod to "Hooshews" via screen content, documents, or a tiny logo — but only if it fits naturally.
- Ensure the image is suitable for a 16:9 blog thumbnail and feels like a trustworthy tech news source.
