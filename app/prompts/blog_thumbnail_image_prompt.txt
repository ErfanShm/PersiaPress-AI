Image Prompt for Blog Post Thumbnail:

Create image for a blog post thumbnail.
- Visualize the core theme of the `[HEADER]` and `[DESCRIPTION]` in a modern, vibrant, high-conversion 16:9 style.
- Prefer a stylized, creative, or slightly conceptual visual language (not overly realistic), appropriate for AI, tech, and futuristic topics.
- You may represent abstract ideas metaphorically or symbolically.
- Subtly include the provided character's likeness as a minor, natural part of the scene â€” not central, not pasted in, but blended contextually like an easter egg.
- Use the Hooshews brand color `#4379f2` only as a small accent detail (not background or dominant color).
- If character blending or Hooshews reference feels forced, prioritize visual coherence and uniqueness.
- Make sure the image is suitable for a blog thumbnail and encourages high click-through rates.
