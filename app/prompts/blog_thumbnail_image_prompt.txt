Image Prompt for Blog Post Thumbnail:

Generate a single, creative prompt for an AI news blog post thumbnail:
- Start with: `Create image for a blog post thumbnail.`
- Visualize the core theme of the `[HEADER]` and `[DESCRIPTION]` in a style that's vibrant, modern, and eye-catching.
- Subtly include the provided character's likeness as a minor, natural part of the scene (not the main focus, not pasted in, but blended in contextuallyâ€”like an easter egg).
- Use the Hooshews brand color `#4379f2` only as a small accent (never as the main theme or background).
- Add a subtle reference to "Hooshews" if possible.
- Ensure the image is unique, high-CTR, and suitable for a 16:9 thumbnail.
- **Respond only with the generated image prompt.**
