# üìÑ PersiaPress AI

Automate your WordPress workflow: Generate Persian blog posts from English sources using AI and publish drafts instantly.

Welcome to the **PersiaPress AI** repository! This project implements a Streamlit-based web application designed to streamline the process of creating Persian blog content for a WordPress website (`hooshews.com`) from English source material, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). It supports saving generated content both locally and to Pantry Cloud, and allows loading previous work from both sources.

The application consists of the following core components:
- **Streamlit UI (`app/ui.py`, `app/app.py`):** Provides the web interface for user input (source article details, image upload), loading previous work, and output display.
- **Content Generation Logic (`app/content_generator.py`):** Handles the core logic of orchestrating LLM calls to generate various content pieces (blog posts, Instagram texts, story teasers, image prompts).
- **LLM Client Management (`app/llm_clients.py`):** Manages the initialization of LLM clients (e.g., `ChatOpenAI`).
- **WordPress Interaction (`app/wordpress_handler.py`):** Contains functions for interacting with the WordPress REST API (creating posts, uploading media, managing tags, etc.).
- **File & Pantry Utilities (`app/file_utils.py`):** Manages saving output locally and to Pantry Cloud (using `aiohttp` for async operations), loading from Pantry, and other file-related utilities.
- **General Utilities (`app/utils.py`):** May contain other miscellaneous helper functions.
- **Configuration (`dotenv`):** Manages sensitive information like API keys, WordPress credentials, and Pantry ID.

This tool aims to automate the translation, SEO optimization, and initial drafting process for blog posts, enhancing collaboration through cloud-synced outputs identified by username.

## ‚ú® Overview

This project provides a web interface built with Streamlit that takes details of an English source article. It then uses configured LLM clients to generate a comprehensive Persian blog post package. This package includes translated and SEO-optimized content, metadata (title, slug, meta description, image alt text, tags, focus keywords), and social media content (Instagram posts & stories, image prompts). The application can save these outputs locally and to Pantry Cloud, with filenames/basket names prefixed by username for team collaboration. Users can also load previously generated work from either local storage or Pantry Cloud. Finally, it interacts with a WordPress site's REST API to automatically create draft posts.

Key features include:

*   **LLM-Powered Content Generation:** Utilizes LLMs for a full Persian blog package and social media content from English input.
*   **WordPress Draft Creation:** Automates draft post creation via the WordPress REST API.
*   **Dual Save & Load:**
    *   Saves generated outputs locally (in `answers/`) and to Pantry Cloud.
    *   Allows loading previous work from local JSON files or Pantry Cloud baskets.
*   **Username Prefixing:** Prepends `WP_USERNAME` (from `.env`) to saved filenames and Pantry basket names for easy identification in team environments.
*   **Asynchronous Cloud Operations:** Uses `aiohttp` for non-blocking communication with Pantry Cloud.
*   **Markdown to HTML Conversion & Tag Management.**
*   **Featured Image Upload & Handling.**
*   **Streamlit Web Interface.**
*   **(Attempted) Rank Math Integration.**

## üìù Usage Guide

1.  Launch and access the Streamlit app.
2.  **Input Source:** Fill in English article details.
3.  **Generate Content:** Click "‚ú® Generate Persian Blog Post Package".
    *   Optionally select/deselect checkboxes for Instagram post/story generation.
4.  **Review Output:** Examine generated content. Outputs are automatically saved locally (e.g., `answers/your_username_0001_slug_timestamp.json`) and to Pantry if configured.
5.  **Upload Thumbnail:** Use the image uploader.
6.  **(Optional) Load Existing Output:**
    *   **Local:** Use the "Upload a previously generated .json file" to load a file from your computer.
    *   **Pantry Cloud:** If `PANTRY_ID` is set, use the "Load from Pantry Cloud" section. Click "Fetch Baskets from Pantry", select a basket (e.g., `your_username_0001_slug_timestamp`), and click "Load Selected Pantry Basket".
7.  **Create WordPress Draft:** Click "üöÄ Create Draft Post in WordPress".
8.  **Verify:** Check WordPress admin.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details

### LLM Usage
*   Uses `langchain-openai`'s `ChatOpenAI` client via `app.llm_clients`.
*   Content generation is orchestrated in `app.content_generator` with detailed prompts.

### WordPress Interaction (`requests`)
*   Managed by `app.wordpress_handler`.
*   Uses `requests` for synchronous communication with WordPress REST API.

### Data Persistence & Cloud Sync (`app.file_utils`, `aiohttp`)
*   `app.file_utils` contains logic for data handling.
*   Local saves: JSON files to `answers/`, prefixed with sanitized `WP_USERNAME`.
*   Pantry Cloud: If `PANTRY_ID` is set, saves to Pantry using `aiohttp` for asynchronous `POST` requests. Basket names are also prefixed with username.
*   Pantry Loading: Lists baskets and fetches content asynchronously using `aiohttp`.

### UI (`streamlit`)
*   Managed by `app.ui` and `app.app`.
*   Uses `asyncio.run` to integrate asynchronous Pantry loading functions into Streamlit's synchronous flow.

### File Handling & Logging
*   Standard Python libraries (`os`, `dotenv`, `logging`, `markdown`, `Pillow`, `mimetypes`).

## üìà Current Status & Future Plans

### Current Status
*   Core workflow functional: LLM generation, local/Pantry saving (with username prefix), loading from local/Pantry, WordPress draft creation.
*   Pantry operations are asynchronous.
*   Rank Math API integration remains potentially unreliable.
*   Non-ASCII tag creation via API is disabled.

### Future Enhancements
*   (No change from previous, potential improvements still valid)
    *   Resolving network/SSL errors for WordPress.
    *   Improving Rank Math integration.
    *   Solution for non-ASCII tags.
    *   More robust error handling.
    *   Internal linking.
    *   Testing.
