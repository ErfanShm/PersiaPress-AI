## 🌟 Project Overview

The PersiaPress AI project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to automate and streamline the creation of Persian blog content for WordPress from English source material.

**Main Purpose & Problem Solved:**
The primary goal of PersiaPress AI is to simplify and accelerate the process of generating engaging Persian blog posts for the `hooshews.com` WordPress site. It addresses the challenge of manually translating, adapting, and optimizing content for a Persian audience, a task that can be time-consuming and require significant effort. It also aims to enhance collaboration among content creators by providing a centralized platform with cloud-synchronized outputs.

**Key Features & Functionalities (High-Level):**
*   **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a comprehensive package from English source articles. This includes a Persian blog post (translated and SEO-optimized), title, slug, meta description, image alt text, focus keywords, and tags. It also generates social media content like Instagram posts/stories and image prompts (both artistic and realistic styles).
*   **Advanced SEO Optimization:** Implements comprehensive SEO strategies including E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness), semantic keyword integration, strategic keyword placement, and modern SEO best practices for high Rank Math scores.
*   **Persian Localization:** Specialized for Iranian audience with cultural references, Persian idioms, voice search optimization, and mobile-first design considerations.
*   **WordPress Integration:** Directly interacts with the WordPress REST API to automate the creation of draft posts. This includes uploading featured images and managing tags.
*   **Dual Save & Load Capabilities:**
    *   **Local Storage:** Saves all generated content as JSON files in a local `answers/` directory.
    *   **Pantry Cloud Integration:** Optionally saves and loads content to/from Pantry Cloud, enabling easy sharing and access across a team. These cloud operations are performed asynchronously.
*   **Collaboration Support:** Generated files and Pantry Cloud basket names are prefixed with the user's WordPress username (`WP_USERNAME`), making it easier to identify and manage content in a team environment.
*   **User-Friendly Web Interface:** Utilizes Streamlit to provide an interactive interface for inputting source article details, uploading images, initiating content generation, loading previous work, and publishing to WordPress.
*   **Content Processing:** Includes features like converting generated Markdown content to HTML for WordPress compatibility.
*   **Image Generation:** Creates optimized image prompts for blog thumbnails, Instagram posts, and social media content with brand authenticity and news relevance.

**Target User:**
The application is targeted towards content creators, bloggers, digital marketers, or editorial teams who manage a Persian-language WordPress website and wish to efficiently repurpose English content using AI. The features facilitating team collaboration (cloud storage, username prefixing) imply its suitability for small to medium-sized content teams.

## 🔄 Application Workflow

The PersiaPress AI application follows a user-driven workflow, orchestrated by the Streamlit interface defined in `app/ui.py`.

**1. Initialization and LLM Client Setup:**
*   When the user launches the application (`streamlit run app/app.py`), the `main()` function in `app/ui.py` is executed.
*   It first checks for the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable. If not found, it displays an error and stops.
*   It then calls `initialize_llm_clients()` from `app/llm_clients.py` to set up the necessary Large Language Model clients. If this fails, an error is displayed.

**2. User Input for New Content Generation:**
*   The UI presents input fields for the English source title, body, source name, and URL.
*   Checkboxes allow the user to select optional content like Instagram texts, story teasers, and an Iranian Farsi video prompt.

**3. (Optional) Loading Previous Work:**
   Users can load previously generated content:
*   **Local File Upload:** Via `st.file_uploader` for JSON files from the `answers/` folder.
*   **Pantry Cloud Loading:** If `PANTRY_ID` is configured, users can fetch and select baskets from Pantry Cloud.

**4. Content Generation Process:**
*   Clicking "✨ Generate Persian Blog Post Package" triggers `generate_persian_blog_package()` from `app/content_generator.py`.
*   This function uses the initialized LLM clients and source details to produce the Persian blog package, SEO metadata, image prompts, etc.
*   **Data Saving (Automatic):** The generated output is saved locally (to `answers/`) and to Pantry Cloud (if configured) by functions in `app/file_utils.py`.

**5. Displaying Generated/Loaded Content:**
*   The UI presents the generated or loaded data in expandable sections (Metadata, Blog Content, Image Prompts, Instagram Content, etc.).

**6. Thumbnail Image Upload (Blog):**
*   Users can upload a thumbnail image, which is saved locally to the `images/` directory in WEBP format.

**7. Publishing to WordPress:**
*   Clicking "Create Draft Post in WordPress" calls `create_draft_post()` from `app/wordpress_handler.py`.
*   This function sends the title, content, slug, tags, SEO metadata, and the locally saved image (if found) to the WordPress REST API to create a draft post.

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation Details

### LLM Usage
*   Uses `langchain-openai`'s `ChatOpenAI` client via `app.llm_clients`.
*   Content generation is orchestrated in `app.content_generator` with detailed prompts.
*   Enhanced prompts include E-E-A-T optimization, semantic keyword integration, and Persian localization.

### WordPress Interaction (`requests`)
*   Managed by `app.wordpress_handler`.
*   Uses `requests` for synchronous communication with WordPress REST API.

### Data Persistence & Cloud Sync (`app.file_utils`, `aiohttp`)
*   `app.file_utils` contains logic for data handling.
*   Local saves: JSON files to `answers/`, prefixed with sanitized `WP_USERNAME`.
*   Pantry Cloud: If `PANTRY_ID` is set, saves to Pantry using `aiohttp` for asynchronous `POST` requests. Basket names are also prefixed with username.
*   Pantry Loading: Lists baskets and fetches content asynchronously using `aiohttp`.

### UI (`streamlit`)
*   Managed by `app.ui` and `app.app`.
*   Uses `asyncio.run` to integrate asynchronous Pantry loading functions into Streamlit's synchronous flow.

### File Handling & Logging
*   Standard Python libraries (`os`, `dotenv`, `logging`, `markdown`, `Pillow`, `mimetypes`).

### SEO & Content Optimization
*   Comprehensive SEO strategies implemented in prompts
*   E-E-A-T optimization for search engine trust
*   Semantic keyword integration with natural language flow
*   Strategic keyword placement and content structure optimization
